ðŸŽ‰ I've completed the #21DaysStreak - POTD challenge over the course of 21 days with the help of Deutsche Bank and GeeksforGeeks! 
It was really a thrilling and stimulating experience that challenged me every day!ðŸš€ 

I want to take a moment to say a big thank you to GeeksforGeeks and Deutsche Bank for this amazing opportunity. 
Joining the hashtag#geekstreak2024 really changed my experience with challenges. Before this, I had never stuck to something like this, so Iâ€™m proud that I completed my very first streak! 
The chance to win that stylish bag from Deutsche Bank definitely kept me excited and motivated to participate every day.

So, here's how this 21-Day Challenge has helped me:
âž£ During these 21 days, I created a GitHub repository to track my progress and the problems I worked on. 
It felt great to have a place to show what I was doing, and I know it will be useful for future job opportunities. 
Sharing my daily updates on X helped me connect with others who were also taking part, which made the experience even better. 
It was nice to see fellow coders sharing their journeys, especially on days when I needed a little extra motivation.

âž£ This challenge taught me a lot, not just about coding but also about important life lessons. 
One of the biggest things I learned was the importance of being consistent. It was tough to show up and code every day, especially when life got busy or overwhelming. 
But developing that discipline really improved my coding skills and helped me create a routine I want to keep going.

âž£ I also learned the value of perseverance. There were times when I got stuck on a problem, and while I sometimes looked up existing solutions for help, I always tried to solve the problem on my own first. 
Each time I overcame a challenge, I felt more confident in my abilities and gained a better understanding of the concepts. 
It was empowering to push through those tough moments, and it motivated me to keep going.

Overall, the hashtag#geekstreak2024 was an incredible experience that helped me grow in so many ways. 
I truly appreciate the support from everyone who made this challenge so engaging and fun.
